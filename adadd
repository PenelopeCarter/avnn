            You’re moving with your best friend to the city of Kredon, home to
            some of the best schools and universities in the country, to
            continue your studies. However, in Kredon, there’s only one thing
            everyone talks about: ETERNUM—the virtual, hyper-reality MMORPG game
            released a few years ago that revolutionized the world of
            technology. With a neural implant that recreates the five senses, it
            becomes impossible to distinguish between the game and the real
            world. Thousands of servers form the network of Eternum: from
            colorful, magic-filled fantasy worlds to foggy sci-fi cities, no
            world is beyond reach. Nevertheless, looking beyond the surface,
            there's a darker side to this pretty facade: black markets, torture,
            rape, illegal content trafficking, unlawful assemblies, data theft…
            Eternum follows the rules of no man. For some reason, governments
            turn a blind eye to this; there’s no regulation and no control. Some
            say it’s because the game is highly addictive, some say it’s because
            the market moves millions of dollars daily, some say those in power
            have been bribed, and others say… there’s something else going on.
            And you? What’s your role in this story? Well... That’s up to you
            now.

            discover that this place hides some deep dark secrets and things can

            It has been many years since the End of Days. Old civilizations

            wasteland somewhere in Egypt. Desert Stalker puts the player in the

            interacts with various people that are trying to find their place in
            this new world. Throughout the game you will meet girls and their
            tribes, slaves and their Queens, and whether you are taking a
            romantic or dominant approach, your actions may decide more than
            just their fates.

      In this deceivingly heartwarming story, Kei was born and raised in a
      family shrouded by mysteries and untold stories. After losing your loved
      one in a tragic incident, you chose to distance yourself from others,
      believing that your presence alone was the cause of their harm and pain.
      As you try to get back on your feet, you move to a shared house, starting
      to open up once again. However, shortly after moving on from your painful
      past, you learn that your significant other is still alive. It seems that
      her abduction wasn't a simple string of bad luck but something much more
      insidious – directly connected to your family's secrets, kept hidden for
      decades. With the shadowy forces setting their plan in motion, will you be
      able to stop it and protect those who are dear to you? Or will you let
      them die?

      What we are presenting to you is a harem simulator. You, as a young
      capable college rich kid, versus 7 gorgeous girls with different
      backgrounds and personalities. The story is not only about sex, but also
      about romance and love fantasies. We wish you could immerse yourself in
      the plots, discover more of the girls by yourself, and enjoy the feeling
      of developing your harem. I am proud of my skill in character making, and
      I have spent enormous time on creating the seven heroines of this game.
      Each of them has her unique background, characteristics, habits, and the
      philosophy of love. They are not just some pretty sluts you saw in other
      places who know nothing but sex. I wish everyone could find his dream
      lover or lovers among them.

      You are the hero - or possibly villain - of this tale, originally on
      a journey to discover why your family was driven out of your home
      town, but quickly thrust into events beyond anything you could ever
      have imagined. As tensions rise between the humans and the mythical
      creatures that lurk just outside of sight, will you stand as a
      beacon of hope... or use your newfound power to bring the world
      under your control?

      apathy and reset your life. For the first time ever, you've decided
      to make a move on your own terms. Ardoria, the city of life and

      In a conflict between the races, a group of brave warriors supported
      by the gods purge a dark race of demons from existence. But due to
      the mercy of one warrior, one demon child is spared as she decides
      not only to spare him, but also to take him with her and raise him.
      A few years later, the incubus grows into an adult and wishes to set
      off in an adventure.

      It is a story about love and lust in our lives, about what their
      absence leads to and what forms they can take. In this game, you'll
      be playing as a 29-year-old guy who gets involved in unexpected
      mystical events. His life gets turned on its head and he has to
      survive in the new world he's found himself in. But it's not as grim
      as it seems at first glance. As you play, you'll meet girls who need
      you just like you need them. Will you make them yours, seduce them,
      or cherish and love them? It's up to you. Each of them has their own
      background, character, and hidden fetishes...

      After being made redundant at your old job as a Lab Technician,
      you've found an opportunity you cannot refuse! You have successfully
      secured a new job at a college! But there's something strange...
      this college isn't government-run! What could this mean? It's time
      to find out, and make some new (and old) acquaintances.
