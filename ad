            <p>You’re moving with your best friend to the city of Kredon, home to some of the best schools and universities in the country, to continue your studies. However, in Kredon, there’s only one thing everyone talks about: ETERNUM—the virtual, hyper-reality MMORPG game released a few years ago that revolutionized the world of technology.
                With a neural implant that recreates the five senses, it becomes impossible to distinguish between the game and the real world.
                Thousands of servers form the network of Eternum: from colorful, magic-filled fantasy worlds to foggy sci-fi cities, no world is beyond reach.
                Nevertheless, looking beyond the surface, there's a darker side to this pretty facade: black markets, torture, rape, illegal content trafficking, unlawful assemblies, data theft… Eternum follows the rules of no man.
                For some reason, governments turn a blind eye to this; there’s no regulation and no control. Some say it’s because the game is highly addictive, some say it’s because the market moves millions of dollars daily, some say those in power have been bribed, and others say… there’s something else going on.
                And you? What’s your role in this story?
                Well... That’s up to you now.</p>

            <p>You live in Mistbury, an apparently normal town where you live an apparently normal life with your family. However, you'll soon discover that this place hides some deep dark secrets and things can heat up very fast...

                From infiltrating into a prison to exploring mysterious mansions and traveling to the other side of the world: embark on an adventure of conspiracies, meeting bizarre characters, living unique experiences, seducing gorgeous girls and, if there's time, saving the world.
                
                If Astaroth seizes power, it will be the end for all of us.
                Only you can stop him.

            <p>It has been many years since the End of Days. Old civilizations collapsed, and new ones are slowly arising in what is now an arid wasteland somewhere in Egypt.

                Desert Stalker puts the player in the shoes of the titular MC, a family man and citizen of Zeta, as he interacts with various people that are trying to find their place in this new world.
                
                Throughout the game you will meet girls and their tribes, slaves and their Queens, and whether you are taking a romantic or dominant approach, your actions may decide more than just their fates.</p>

Yet even as the tempest brews on the horizon with Price Industries at its core, the authorities remain curiously indifferent.
  
  The stakes are higher than ever, and the very lives of August City's residents hang in the balance. Will you step up and forge alliances to unmask the true nature of this malevolent force? The fate of the city lies in your hands.
  
  Discover the hidden truths that lurk beneath the shadows of August City in Unraveling August.
